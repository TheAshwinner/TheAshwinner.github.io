Hi! I'm Ashwin Sreevatsa. I'm currently a software engineer at Google. This website is mostly for me to share notes, projects, random ideas, etc. that I'm currently working on or thinking about.

Some topics I think about often: AI alignment/control, math, rationality, machine learning infrastructure.
